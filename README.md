Welcome to the ft_irc called "LRC" based on its creator (Liberal/lliberal, Rubens/rteles-f and Chaleira/plopes-c) <br><br>

The ft_irc - Internet Relay Chat -  is a Project about Sockets, Servers, Connections and Clients. For 42 Students: It's also your first chance to truly explore and develop your skills in Object Oriented Programming, and I highly recommend you try your best to code in this fashion, as it is a very important and modern tool for programmers. <br><br>

Our Server uses The Observer Pattern, the poll() function, and 4 classes: <br>
markup :
* Server - Who manages connections and Acts as the observer; <br> 
* Channels - That groups clients and manages this group;
* Connections - That Handle all the in and out of Clients and sockets;
* Clients - That stores, handles all Clients operations and inputs, and Acts as the Subjects;
