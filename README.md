Welcome to the ft_irc called "LRC" based on its creator (Liberal/lliberal, Rubens/rteles-f and Chaleira/plopes-c) <br><br>

The ft_irc - Internet Relay Chat -  is a Project about Sockets, Servers, Connections and Clients. For 42 Students: It's also your first chance to truly explore and develop your skills in Object Oriented Programming, and I highly recommend you try your best to code in this fashion, as it is a very important and modern tool for programmers. <br><br>

The core of our project is the combination of the principles in Observer Pattern, the std::map container, and function pointers, making the Server concise, highly adaptable and easy to correct/maintain. <br>
For classes we needed: <br>
* Server - Who manages connections and Acts as the Observer; <br>
* Client - That stores, handles all Clients operations and inputs, and Acts as the Subjects; 
* Channels - That groups clients and manages this group;
* Connections - That handles all the in and out of Clients and sockets;
